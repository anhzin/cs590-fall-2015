# Homework 3

This homework assignment is an extension of the second homework assignment.  Students will add more features to the event-driven architecture pattern.

The heart of this assignment is to construct a single page application (SPA), which means there is *no* submit button.  Your entire application must work within the context of a single page.

Let us break this down further by way of describing the customer's requirements:

* Students must be able to see quizzes (for now you can hard-code in 4 quizzes)
* Students must be able to see homework assignments (for now you can hard-code in 4 homework assignments)
* Students must be able to take quizzes -- note that there is no `submit` button, instead there should be a `done` button and this button saves the quiz state to the database
* Students must be able to see current all grades 
* Students must be able to logout

## Design the homework

You should spend sometime design the system.  How this system would work when you put the components together.  Again an architectural diagram will come in handy.
