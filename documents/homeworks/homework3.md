# Homework 3

This homework assignment is an extension of the second homework assignment.  Students will add more features to the event driven architecture pattern.

The heart of this assignment is to construct a single page application (SPA), which means there is *no* `submit` button.  Your entire application must work within the context of a single page.

Let us break this down further by way of describing the customer's requirements:

* Students must be able to view quizzes (for now you can hard-code 4 quizzes)
* Students must be able to view homework assignments (for now you can hard-code  4 homework assignments) and for each assignment there should be an `upload` button
* Students must be able to take quizzes.  Note since there is no `submit` button, there should be a `done` button.  This button push the content of the quiz to the server which saves state to the database
* Students must be able to see up-to-date grades 

## Design the homework

You should spend sometime design the system.  Some obvious considerations: 

* How does this system would work when you put the components together?  
* Like the previous assignment, an architectural diagram will come in handy.
* What are tradeoffs and design decision you must make as an architect?

## Evaluation

You will demonstrate the assignment to the instructor.  Also present architecture diagram(s) and discuss your design and implementation.
