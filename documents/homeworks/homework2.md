# Homework 2

For this homework assignment you will update the code from homework 1 so that it performs validation on the username and password strength on the registration page.  Your code must use the event-driven pattern architecture.

### Username validation

There are many ways to perform validation on the username.  The most basic approach is as the user types in the username, the system will detect to see if such a name exist in the system.

### Password strength validation

The requirements on the password strength are:

1. Minimum 8 characters
2. One upper case
3. One number
4. One symbol

Again, a simple approach is to type the password and the system would continuously check to see if this password is good enough. User will be notified when the password strength has been met. 

The homework grade will be graded as followed:

* Completion: Everything works 8 pts
* Discussion: I will ask you questions on your assignment 2 pt

Note that discussion will involved: 

1. Showing me your architecture diagram
2. Demonstrating that you understand the code

If you do not understand the code, I will consider it not completed.
