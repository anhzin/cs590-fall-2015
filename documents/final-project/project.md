# Final Project

Here are the requirements for the final project:

* You should tie together assignments and lectures to include the following:
   * login and registration
   * quiz and grade
   * security (session or token)

* You **do not** have to do homework page/tab

* Your software must be able to support dynamic
  * You **cannot hard code** anything, for example number of quizzes, number of questions per quiz, or number of choices per question
  * Grades should be reflect the actual quiz results

You can think of being dynamic as followed, if the teacher wants to add new a new quiz, does he/she have to edit `.html`, `.clj`, or `.cljs`. If the answer is yes then it is _not_ dynamic

* Please be prepared to discuss architecture, trade design decision, guide rails, etc.

* You will also be measured on the _quality of the product_ in other words, is this a graduate-level product or is this an undergraduate-level product.  While this might appear to be subjective, it is in fact not.  Please take a look at [web pages that suck](http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/) for inspiration.  Ask yourself, how does your product measure up to [them](http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/)?

Finally, I am interested in your explanation of the architecture.  Be sure to understand it thoroughly.  I realize that you are working in teams, please don't hide in the shadow of your teammate.
